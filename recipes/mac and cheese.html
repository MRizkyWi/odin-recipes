    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
      <li>8 ounces elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded extra sharp Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>2 ounces cream cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 2 mini muffin
        pans with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to
        the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium heat. Whisk in flour until
        smooth. Add milk and bring to a simmer. Add 1 1/2 cups Cheddar cheese,
        cream cheese, salt, and pepper. Stir until smooth. Turn heat off.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add drained pasta and beaten egg to cheese sauce and stir until evenly
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a small spoon, divide mixture between mini muffin tins. Sprinkle
        each mac and cheese bite with remaining Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 16 minutes. Remove
        from oven and let stand 5 minutes before serving.
